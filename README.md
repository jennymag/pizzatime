# Pizzatime
This is my first web page made for the project indvidual 1 at KYH collage in Stockholm. 
During this project I have learned Flexbox and how to create animations with CSS.

# Story
My goal with this project was to create a more modern and responsive page for a pizza restaurant, that is as much including as possible. I have been choosing colors, size of text, a semantic code structure and some basic SEO to maintain this.
